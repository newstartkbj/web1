<h2>WEB</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext
  Markup Language (HTML)</a>
  is the standard markup language for
<strong>creating <i><u>web</u></i> pages</strong> and web applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top:30px;">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or
  from local storage and
render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
document.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built. </p>

<p>HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>
